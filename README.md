# Model Football

> *Exploration of various approaches to modelling football matches.*

Will try the following modelling approaches
- [Poisson regression model](https://www.robert-hickman.eu/post/dixon_coles_1/)
- [Bayesian Possion regression model](https://opisthokonta.net/?p=850)
- [Bayesian hierarchical model](http://www.statistica.it/gianluca/publication/baio-blangiardo-2010/)

## What was the motivation?
Football predictions are hard and typically, bookies do a better job at it (probably because they hire the most talented statisticians and modellers). This project is not an attempt to accurately predict football matches per se; it is a personal odessey to explore existing approaches.
